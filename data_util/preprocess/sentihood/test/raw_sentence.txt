if money is no object look at location and location 
if not the local council may have records in their libraries department there was one on location flats location e they wre identified by a yellow diomond on the back of thier tunic

if you are on a budget people usually stay in the location area which is very popular and has pretty good nightlife of its own
if you are poor you might live in location 
if you are working in the london location is only mins on c c overland train which is good if you do n t much fancy the tube
if you can afford it then location where location is is gorgeous but out of most people s price ranges

if you miss your countrymen then i think that location is the place to be
if you want location then outer south east london makes the most sense
if you want to go out drinking where the cool kids go head to location 
if you want to live in location try aiming for location 
if you want to live in the middle of it all then somewhere like the docklands is good especially location which is very touristy
if you were to look at your one hour limit in terms of time rather than distance you can get a long way from location or location stations in an hour and live a bit further out
if you wish to live closer to central london look into areas like location location 
if you re looking at areas to live location and location are fine

islam has not taken this area over so it s not all bad but location council is loony left pc brigade another yank that seems to think that the uk is ruled by people that think women should cover up
it s a myth that location is cheap prices have shot up due to the olympics the words dont cost too much and london dont belong in the same sentence
it actually shows that the most dangerous area is probably the area you immediately think of when you think of london location 
it annoys me when people say i live in location location etc when they rent and i am just thinking you don t really live there because you don t own it
it depends on which bit of location you are looking at

just avoid location and location unless you want to just go home and stay at home each evening some parts are rough
just be careful of location it can be scary there especially when traveling there at night alone
just exercise the same caution as you would do at home location is half gentrified and upmarket and the other half is full of bars and restaurants v safe
just outside the main location area is very different though
just up to road in location is plain dangerous i myself was mugged with a knife there once and i would thoroughly discourage you to look for anything there

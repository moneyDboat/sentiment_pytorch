also worth a visit is location for it s famous horsestable market which is like an aladdin s cave of curios
also i m not sure whether you d consider this a good or a bad thing i say good but location in particular happens to have a fairly sizeable irish population

alternatively trent park in location has a small animal section
alternatively move to somewhere like location ro location which isnt london but is still within minutes
alternatively try location location loads of bars and restaurants 
alternatively location s likely the closest to the centre you can get while still being able to pay rent and bills without eating bread and butter all month
although location has had a bad reputation in the past i have lived here for years now and have found the area i live in very friendly and quiet
although location is picturesque with its park and it does have quite a high crime rate and because it is close to the centre of london it is rarther expensive

and to make matters worse this has spread to most areas of location with the support of new labour movement
and you don t have a cockney accent if you re from location 
another area location would be the cheapest on the list but has a high crime rate i think location n is getting expensive for very solid reasons
another area you might look at too is location which has most of the same qualities but the journey to gatwick will be longer from there yeah east location is fairly accessible to london

anyway i hope this helps i know location pretty well lived here all my life
anyway location is where a lot of my year old friends live
anywhere but location or location 
anywhere around location and location for example can command extortionate rent
anywhere around location is up and coming with the new olympic village being built and its accompanying westfiled shopping centre

apart from there you could also find them in location and location along the a which is a big turkish and kurdish area we are a family with a thirteen year old daughter who currently live in spain and are in the process of moving to the uk london specifically
apart from there you could also find them in location and location along the a which is a big turkish and kurdish area i can t agree with musical that all fast food restaurants in london are halal but they are very common usually display their status on the window or frontage and range from fairly basic chicken n chip places to some fairly smart joints

areas quite far north such as location are really nice
areas such as location location are lovely residential quiet and close to the center
areas such as location and location are good for low crime levels
areas such as location and location are pleasant but expensive
areas that i dont feel quite so safe in places like location 
around location is probably the best choice
around location n good public transport but choose the location carefully
as location has a black community and location chinese etc 
as location isnt on the tube housing is a bit cheaper and i think its fairly nice
as a general rule avoid certain areas of south london such as location and the location complex which have bad reputations for drugs and gun crime
as close to location as possible
as far as i know if you re looking for low crime rates location is not really an option
as far as living nearby location and location are much better
as far as safety goes i would say location would be the better choice live in location 
as for location 
as for location well it s not the safest of places
as for location its equally affluent and comes with some of the most exclusive real state in the world
as for airports if you choose location then location is the best bet
as for areas to live yeah location sw is great if youre a millionaire
as for using postcodes it does give the person a rough idea of where in london the suburb is for example if you said it was in n you know that is location 
as for what to do location is great for indie pubs and gigs as is location 
as much as i love location i wouldn t say it s the best it also depends on what your looking for in an area
as others have said avoid location like the plague its got no soul
as someone else said it s a football team not an area so your question doesn t really make any sense location on the location no longer houses many people it is a business park really
as someone who does not live in location and compared to other places in london location is a rough area
as soon as you go outside zone i e location the prices are so high
as well as being steeped in a rich history location has a living thriving vibrant community
as you earn more you can then decide more positively where to live when you start earning more any where but location its rough and dangerous
aside from that i will warn you that housing prices are probably ridiculous in location 
at location you can see the cutty sark ship museum and see where latitude or greenwich mean time starts
at least location has a tube
at least in location etc there is alot of violence
at night prostitutes take over location road lining the main street with pimps and hookers all the way up to location

based on my research so far location location sounds like a nice place to live value for money reasonably safe some bars and cafes 
basically yes there are places to that are leafy and fairly quiet but no where will ever be as quiet as outside london location is okay
be aware that main roads like location road and location road can be pretty noisy
because the location area was built so fast you will find it lacks character as buildings and houses were built so fast and the majority were made to the same specification
better areas include location and location for instance
